## üòî The Problem 
Often times, neurodivergent people are not taught how to regulate themselves, especially in a world that was built on neurotypical standards. Most burn themselves out trying to keep up with these expectations, losing their mental and physical health. This is mainly due to not being taught proper ways to regulate themselves or take care of themselves in a world with such dire consequences for not meeting the aforementioned set standards.

## üçî Product Overview
Burgle!: Remastered is a scheduling app for ADHD/Autistic people, with two core concepts focusing on energy delegation/recovery and structured time management with room for variation. We included a calm and stimulating interface to appeal to struggles with executive dysfunction, creating an addictive healthy habit (dopamine overload, meaning the user is presented with strong and consistent positive emotional feedback). 

This includes making space for: 

* Top Bun - Your morning routine

* Meat - Focusing on one or two aspects of your responsibilities, ex. house chores, work, etc.

* Cheese - A way to wind down/reward yourself in the day

* Sauce - A way to reflect, ex. journaling, meditation, etc.

* Bottom Bun - Your bedtime routine

* "Spoons" (spoon count) - A way to record how much energy you have for the day 

Users will be able to create a mandatory morning and night routine, a specific task for the day, along with including one way to wind down (*the "cheese"*) and one way to reflect (*A new component, the "sauce"*) to prevent burn out and to maintain emotional well-being. Users will delegate a certain amount of spoons per task of the day, representing how much energy each task would require; this provides a way to prevent over-working. By creating new tasks that reflect on the aim of the user's routine, users who find it difficult to accomplish everything they have to get done **will** be able to both manage their obligations and recharge their energy as to not hurt themselves in attempting to meet neurotypical productivity "quotas".

## ü§∏  Mission Statement 
Burgle!: Remastered was inspired by the regulation/time management strategy for people who suffer from executive dysfunction presented by a youtube channel called "[The Thought Spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FHE8AWMKxQ)." In the linked video, a mental health professional discusses how visualizing your day and tasks as components of a sandwich not only simplify your routine, but help people with neurodivergent-structured brains tackle executive dysfunction by focusing on one general task for the day.

**Burgle!: Remastered** takes this one step further and visualizes this into an app that allows users to build their own routines and plan out their tasks with their own custom burger. We aims to empower neurodivergent users by showing there are ways to structure your life, and regulate yourself in order to tend to your obligations without having to burn yourself out in order to survive or make ends meet.
